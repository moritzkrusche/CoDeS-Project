                We would like to invite you to participate in this research project
                directed by researchers at UCL. You should only participate if you want
                to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way.
                Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you
                to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others
                if you wish. Do not hesitate to ask the researcher if there is anything
                that is not clear or if you would like more information
                (<a href='mailto:moritz.krusche.16@ucl.ac.uk'>moritz.krusche.16@ucl.ac.uk</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this experiment, you will play a browser-based computer game as part of
                a research project into human decision-making. The game should be very enjoyable.
                Your goal will be to collect as many resources as you can with a limited
                amount of moves. There will be several different maps throughout the experiment.
                In order to succeed, you will need to balance between exploring new regions of a
                map, and exploiting regions that you already know about.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The approximate duration of this study is <strong>17 minutes.</strong> </li>
                <li>The maximum allowed duration is 35 minutes. If you exceed this time, you can no longer complete the study.</li>
                <li>You will be paid <strong>at least £2</strong> upon successful completion,
                    no matter how well you do, or how long you take.</li>
                <li>If you perform well, you will <strong>earn a sizable bonus</strong>
                    in addition to the basic pay.</li>
                <li>The faster you learn, the more you can earn, because value of rewards decreases over time.</li>
                <li>In order to perform well, you must carefully read the instructions that are displayed throughout the study.</li>

                <li><strong>Important:</strong> the experiment has been carefully designed to work with all
                    modern browsers on a computer, and also with mobile Chrome and Safari browsers on Android and iOS.
                    It will not work with any version of Internet Explorer. There is also a known issue in some versions
                    of Safari that can cause a 1 minute delay at the end, but it should still work.</li>

                <li><strong>If you are using Internet Explorer:</strong> please switch to a modern browser such as
                    Google Chrome / Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Safari. You will not be
                    able to complete this study using Internet Explorer. </li>

                <li> <strong>Acceptance of submissions:</strong> Ordinarily all research participants that complete a study are paid at least
                    the minimum sign-up reward. However, we check responses carefully to make sure that participants are human beings,
                    read the instructions and do not cheat. If you try to cheat or share sensitive information about
                    this study on online forums, your submission <strong>will</strong> be rejected.</li>

                <li>Please also take into account that in this study, you can earn substantially more than the minimum amount
                    if you perform well. This is only possible if you read the instructions carefully. </li>
